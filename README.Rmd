# Experimental Features for Time Series (`exts`)

The skunkworks of SMAC for Time Series. All features here are experimental
and may break at a moments notice! 

# Installation

This package is a non-cran package for the moment being. Thus, to install it
you will need to use [`devtools`](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).

```{r devt, eval = F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SMAC-Group/exts")
```

# Warning

Any function or feature you see here is likely to change or be integrated with
a different package.
