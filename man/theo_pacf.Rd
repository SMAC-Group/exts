\title{Computes the Theoretical Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) of an ARMA process}
\usage{
theo_pacf(model = ARMA(ar = c(0.5, -0.25), ma = 0.2), lag.max = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{lag.max}{A \code{integer} indicating the max length.}
}
\description{
Acts as a wrapper around `ARMAacf` to calculate the theoretical PACF process
of an ARMA process.
}
\examples{
# Computes the theoretical ACF for an ARMA(1,0) or better known as an AR(1)
theo_pacf(ARMA(ar = -0.25, ma = NULL), lag.max = 7)
# Computes the theoretical ACF for an ARMA(2, 1)
theo_pacf(ARMA(ar = ARMA(ar = c(.50, -0.25), ma = .20), lag.max = 10)
